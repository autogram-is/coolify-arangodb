# coolify-arangodb

Quick and dirty ArangoDB service for Coolify.

Unfortunately, an outstanding issue in [Coolify 4.0 betas](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/issues/2470) prevents this from being deployed straight from git. However, you can copy the contents of this `docker-config.yaml` file and set up a fresh new service on your coolify server using the docker compose workflow.

## TODO

- [ ] Map port 8529 in addition to the usual ssl port. Annoying.
